## New ESP32-based MoleNet!

After a long journey, we are finally at a point where we are testing the current version on a larger scale.  
The latest version of MoleNet features several key improvements:

- **ESP32-S3 microcontroller**: A powerful yet energy-efficient processor that supports various development ecosystems including [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and [RiotOS](https://www.riot-os.org/)
- **SDI-12 sensor interface**: Compatible with high-quality environmental sensors
- **Micro-SD card support**: Enables extensive local data storage
- **SX1276-based LoRa transceiver**: Provides long-range wireless communication
- **On-board BME280 sensor**: Measures temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity
- **Low-power design**: Ensures long battery life for extended deployments
- **QWIIC connectivity**: Simplifies integration of I2C-based sensors
