## Pins

For the usage of the pins, please refer to the hardware section in this
document or the schematics of the corresponding versions available in [the PCB-Layouts directory](../PCB-Layouts/).

# Setup using Arduino

1) Install **Arduino IDE** -> [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
2) Install the **esp32** package by Espressif via the **Boards Manager** in the IDE
3) Select the **ESP32S3 Dev Module** as the board
4) Select the corresponding USB port
5) Set USB CDC On Boot: Enabled
6) Set USB Mode: USB-OTG (Tiny USB)

**Attention: Different board types!**

Different ports are created at various times when the MoleNet platform is connected to the computer. One port is to flash the firmware, while the second is to access the MoleNet Platformâ€™s serial port. The first is the default after a reset. The second is usually entered if the boot button is pressed during reset or when powering up the board.

Usually, you have to setup the board twice according to the settings above. Be
aware that the port identifier can change depending on your operating system.

# Setup using MicroPython
