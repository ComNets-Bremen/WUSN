The parameters of the lora.begin() method are related to the LoRa modulation and communication settings. LoRa is a wireless modulation technique that uses chirp spread spectrum (CSS) to encode information. LoRa has several parameters that affect the data rate, range, and power consumption of the transmission and reception. Here is a brief explanation of each parameter:

- **freq**: This parameter sets the carrier frequency of the LoRa signal. The frequency must be within the allowed range for the region and the module. Different regions have different regulations for the use of radio frequencies. For example, in Europe, the LoRa frequency band is 863-870 MHz, while in North America, it is 902-928 MHz¹.
- **bw**: This parameter sets the bandwidth of the LoRa signal. The bandwidth is the range of frequencies that the signal occupies. A higher bandwidth means a higher data rate, but also a higher power consumption and a lower sensitivity. The possible values for the bandwidth are 7.8 kHz, 10.4 kHz, 15.6 kHz, 20.8 kHz, 31.25 kHz, 41.7 kHz, 62.5 kHz, 125 kHz, 250 kHz, and 500 kHz².
- **sf**: This parameter sets the spreading factor of the LoRa signal. The spreading factor is a measure of how many chirps are used to encode a single bit of information. A higher spreading factor means a lower data rate, but also a higher sensitivity and a longer range. The possible values for the spreading factor are from 5 to 12².
- **cr**: This parameter sets the coding rate of the LoRa signal. The coding rate is a measure of how much error correction is applied to the data before transmission. A higher coding rate means a lower data rate, but also a higher robustness against interference and noise. The possible values for the coding rate are from 5 to 8, which correspond to 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, and 4/8 coding rates².
- **syncWord**: This parameter sets the sync word of the LoRa signal. The sync word is a predefined sequence of bits that is used to identify and synchronize with a LoRa signal. Different sync words can be used to create different logical channels or networks within the same frequency band. The default sync word for LoRaWAN® is 0x34².
- **power**: This parameter sets the output power of the LoRa module in dBm. The output power determines how strong the LoRa signal is transmitted by the module. A higher output power means a longer range, but also a higher power consumption and a higher risk of interference with other devices. The possible values for the output power depend on the module and its configuration¹.
- **currentLimit**: This parameter sets the current limit of the LoRa module in mA. The current limit determines how much current can be drawn by the module during transmission or reception. A higher current limit means a higher output power, but also a higher power consumption and a higher risk of overheating or damaging the module. The possible values for the current limit depend on the module and its configuration¹.
- **preambleLength**: This parameter sets the preamble length of the LoRa signal in symbols. The preamble is a sequence of alternating ones and zeros that is used to indicate the start of a LoRa packet and to allow the receiver to adjust its frequency and timing. A longer preamble means a higher robustness against packet loss, but also a longer transmission time and a higher power consumption².
- **implicit**: This parameter sets whether to use implicit or explicit header mode for LoRa transmission and reception. In implicit header mode, there is no header information in the LoRa packet, such as payload length, coding rate, or CRC presence. In explicit header mode, there is a header information that allows dynamic configuration of these parameters for each packet². Implicit header mode can save some transmission time and power consumption, but it requires that both transmitter and receiver have fixed and identical settings for these parameters.
- **implicitLen**: This parameter sets the payload length in bytes for implicit header mode for LoRa transmission and reception. In implicit header mode, there is no way for the receiver to know how long the payload is, so it must be predefined by both transmitter and receiver². This parameter has no effect if implicit header mode is not used.
Continuing the explanation of the parameters of the lora.begin() method:

- **crcOn**: This parameter sets whether to enable or disable CRC check for LoRa transmission and reception. CRC stands for cyclic redundancy check, which is a method of detecting errors in the data. A CRC value is calculated from the data and appended to the end of the packet. The receiver can then verify the CRC value and discard the packet if it does not match. Enabling CRC can improve the reliability of the communication, but it also adds some overhead to the packet size².
- **txIq**: This parameter sets whether to enable or disable inverted IQ signals for LoRa transmission. IQ stands for in-phase and quadrature, which are two components of a complex signal that represent its amplitude and phase. Inverting the IQ signals means swapping the in-phase and quadrature components, which results in a phase shift of 180 degrees. Inverting the IQ signals can be used to avoid interference with other LoRa devices that use the same frequency and sync word².
- **rxIq**: This parameter sets whether to enable or disable inverted IQ signals for LoRa reception. This parameter must match the txIq parameter of the transmitter, otherwise the receiver will not be able to decode the signal correctly².
- **tcxoVoltage**: This parameter sets the TCXO reference voltage in volts for LoRa module. TCXO stands for temperature-compensated crystal oscillator, which is a type of oscillator that provides a stable frequency output regardless of temperature variations. Some LoRa modules use a TCXO to generate the carrier frequency, and they require a specific reference voltage to operate correctly. The possible values for the TCXO voltage depend on the module and its configuration¹.
- **useRegulatorLDO**: This parameter sets whether to use LDO or DC/DC regulator for LoRa module power supply. LDO stands for low-dropout regulator, which is a type of regulator that provides a constant output voltage with a low voltage difference between input and output. DC/DC stands for direct current to direct current converter, which is a type of regulator that can step up or step down the input voltage to provide a constant output voltage. Some LoRa modules have both types of regulators and can switch between them depending on the power requirements. Using LDO can reduce the power consumption, but it also reduces the output power range¹.
- **blocking**: This parameter sets whether to use blocking or non-blocking mode for LoRa transmission and reception. In blocking mode, the lora.send() and lora.receive() methods will wait until the operation is completed before returning. In non-blocking mode, these methods will return immediately and allow other code to run while the operation is in progress. Non-blocking mode requires using interrupts or polling to check when the operation is done¹.
